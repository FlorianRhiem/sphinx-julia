Sphinx-Julia
============

Documenting Julia projects with `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_. This project provides at the moment two extensions which try to provide the same functionality as their python counterparts:

``Julia domain``
    Define Julia language in docutils/sphinx terms.

``Julia autodoc``
    Automatically include docstrings from julia files.
